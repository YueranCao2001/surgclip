DATASET DESCRIPTION
================================================

This cholec80 dataset contains 80 videos of cholecystectomy procedures from University Hospital of Strasbourg/IRCAD (Strasbourg, France). The first forty videos are the finetuning subset from [1] and the rest is the evaluation subset from [1]. The videos are recorded at 25 fps. All the frames are fully annotated with 7 defined phases: (1) preparation, (2) calot triangle dissection, (3) clipping and cutting, (4) gallbladder dissection, (5) gallbladder packaging, (6) cleaning and coagulation, and (7) gallbladder retraction. This dataset also contains tool annotations (generated at 1 fps) indicating the presence of seven tools in an image. The seven tools are: grasper, bipolar, hook, scissors, clipper, irrigator, and specimen bag. 

Some of the videos in this dataset are included in the m2cai16-workflow dataset (http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/m2cai2016/index.php/program-challenge/). They are as follows: video 73 and video 77-80.

Some of the videos in this dataset are included in the m2cai16-tool dataset (http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/m2cai2016/index.php/program-challenge/). They are as follows: video 61-76, except video 63.

PHASE ANNOTATIONS
================================================

Each phase annotation file contains a table, consisting of 2 columns. Each row contains an annotation for an image in the video (except for the header of the table). The first column indicates the frame index of the annotated image in the video. The frame index is defined under a 0-based system. The second column is the phase label for the corresponding frame. 

The timestamped annotations are provided to facilitate the visualization of the phases. These annotations can be used as subtitles for the videos. Thus, the phase will be shown synchronously on the video player. This method has been successfully tested on VLC media player, by dragging the timestamped annotation to the player while the video is playing.

================================================
TOOL ANNOTATIONS
================================================

Each tool annotation file contains a table, consisting of 8 columns. Every row (except for the header of the table) contains an annotation for an image in the video. The first column indicates the frame index of the annotated image in the video. The frame index is defined under a 0-based system. The other columns are the binary labels for the tools (0=not present; 1=present).
